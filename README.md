# Unity Stylised Shader
Hello there,
Here is my take on a stylised comic book style shader. You can use it in a variety of ways from a standard cell shading to a stylised haftone comic book style. It also has some specular abberation adds a bit of punch and distinction to the specular highlights. Also you can use it as smooth as you like or ramped if you're into that sort of thing.
## How to use
Just import the shader and the HalftoneDot.jpg to your project and dont forget to plug it in the Shade Filter Texture.
